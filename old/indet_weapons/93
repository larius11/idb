Pasha is wanted for his alleged involvement in the shooting death of a man in Atlanta, Georgia, in 1994. While Pasha was working in a convenience store, he allegedly attempted to lock a shoplifter in the store until the police arrived. However, when the shoplifter became verbally belligerent, Pasha allegedly shot him with a handgun and he died a few days later. Shortly thereafter, while being interviewed by the Atlanta Police, Pasha was told that he was being charged with murder. Upon hearing this news, Pasha excused himself to use the restroom and was not seen again.</p>\r\n<p>\u00a0</p>\r\n<p>In late 2000, Pasha was arrested in Brooklyn, New York, and was returned to the state of Georgia. He was then diagnosed with medical problems and the charges against him were dismissed. In October of 2003, information was received that Pasha's medical condition had been misdiagnosed, and the District Attorney's Office decided to reindict him for murder, aggravated assault, and possession of a firearm during the commission of a crime. On January 14, 2004, a federal arrest warrant was issued in the Northern District of Georgia, Atlanta, Georgia, charging Pasha with unlawful flight to avoid prosecution.</p>", "images": [{"large": "https://www.fbi.gov/wanted/murders/mahboob-m.-pasha/@@images/image/large", "caption": null, "original": "https://www.fbi.gov/wanted/murders/mahboob-m.-pasha/@@images/image", "thumb": "https://www.fbi.gov/wanted/murders/mahboob-m.-pasha/@@images/image/thumb"}, {"large": "https://www.fbi.gov/wanted/murders/mahboob-m.-pasha/pasha_mm2.jpg/@@images/image/large", "caption": "", "original": "https://www.fbi.gov/wanted/murders/mahboob-m.-pasha/pasha_mm2.jpg", "thumb": "https://www.fbi.gov/wanted/murders/mahboob-m.-pasha/pasha_mm2.jpg/@@images/image/thumb"}], "nationality": "Pakistani", "height_min": 68, "weight_min": 122, "id": 93}]
