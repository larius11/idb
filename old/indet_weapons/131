On June 8, 1989, Donald Wegner, an Electrician at the VA, was the first person to arrive for work at the VA laundry building at approximately 5:30 a.m. as was his routine. Wegner's co-workers, who arrived for work and were still sitting in their cars, saw him enter the building, but they saw no one enter behind him. Approximately 20 minutes later, another co-worker entered the laundry building and found Wegner lying on the basement floor. Wegner was bleeding, but still alive, however, he died before paramedics arrived.</p>\r\n<p>\u00a0</p>\r\n<p>An autopsy determined that Wegner was beaten to death and that he had a lacerated liver and a fractured skull. A murder weapon was never found, and no suspects were identified.</p>", "images": [{"large": "https://www.fbi.gov/wanted/seeking-info/crime-on-a-government-reservation-murder/@@images/image/large", "caption": null, "original": "https://www.fbi.gov/wanted/seeking-info/crime-on-a-government-reservation-murder/@@images/image", "thumb": "https://www.fbi.gov/wanted/seeking-info/crime-on-a-government-reservation-murder/@@images/image/thumb"}], "nationality": null, "height_min": null, "weight_min": null, "id": 131}]
