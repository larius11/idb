At the time, Allard and his accomplice, <a href=\"https://www.fbi.gov/wanted/dt/jean-pierre-charette\" data-urltype=\"/view\" data-val=\"https://www.fbi.gov/wanted/dt/jean-pierre-charette\" data-linktype=\"external\">Jean-Pierre Charette</a>, were members of a French Canadian Separatist Movement and were fleeing Canada where they were both wanted on bombing charges. Both men booked seats on the flight under alias names. While the plane was over water, Charette, armed with a .38 revolver, allegedly forced a flight attendant at gunpoint to open the cockpit door. Allard, who was armed with a gun and a knife, remained in the First Class section of the plane. Charette then allegedly commanded the pilot to fly to Havana, Cuba.</p>\r\n<p>\u00a0</p>\r\n<p>In 1979, Allard and Charette returned separately to Canada where they were both convicted on their previous bombing charges. The FBI continues to seek the extradition of both men to the United States to face charges for the hijacking. Federal arrest warrants were issued for both Allard and Charette in the United States District Court, Eastern District of New York, on May 4, 1983, after they were charged with conspiracy to commit air piracy and air piracy.</p>", "images": [{"large": "https://www.fbi.gov/wanted/dt/alain-allard/@@images/image/large", "caption": null, "thumb": "https://www.fbi.gov/wanted/dt/alain-allard/@@images/image/thumb", "original": "https://www.fbi.gov/wanted/dt/alain-allard/@@images/image"}, {"large": "https://www.fbi.gov/wanted/dt/alain-allard/alainallard2.jpg/@@images/image/large", "caption": "", "thumb": "https://www.fbi.gov/wanted/dt/alain-allard/alainallard2.jpg/@@images/image/thumb", "original": "https://www.fbi.gov/wanted/dt/alain-allard/alainallard2.jpg"}], "nationality": "Canadian", "height_min": 68, "weight_min": 150, "id": 240}]
