During the evening hours, the victim and some friends were partying outside a trailer when Gonzalez and his brother drove to the area. Gonzalez's brother allegedly got into an argument with the victim while Gonzalez told the victim's friends to stay out of the way. Gonzalez's brother then allegedly retrieved a 20-gauge shotgun from the car and returned to shoot the victim in his stomach at point blank range, killing him. The Gonzalez brothers ran back to their car and left the area. After a local arrest warrant was issued, a federal arrest warrant was issued on October 1, 2003, by the United States District Court, Eastern District of California, Sacramento, California, charging Moises Gonzalez with unlawful flight to avoid prosecution.</p>", "images": [{"large": "https://www.fbi.gov/wanted/murders/moises-galvan-gonzalez/@@images/image/large", "caption": null, "original": "https://www.fbi.gov/wanted/murders/moises-galvan-gonzalez/@@images/image", "thumb": "https://www.fbi.gov/wanted/murders/moises-galvan-gonzalez/@@images/image/thumb"}], "nationality": "Mexican", "height_min": 67, "weight_min": 140, "id": 96}]
