Financial institutions entered into loan agreements with his companies because those companies granted a security interest in their inventory and accounts receivables. Mizrahi and Greenes allegedly submitted fraudulent documents to lending institutions to obtain or increase loans - including accounts receivable summaries, tax returns, borrowing base certificates and financial statements. He allegedly made false statements to obtain loans or increase existing loans for his companies, including displaying inflated company assets, sales and accounts receivable information which he knew were significantly less than the amounts he represented on documents submitted to the financial institutions. Most of the purported inventory and accounts receivables of Mizrahi's companies did not exist and some of the accounts payable were non-existent. The companies' inventory was auctioned off, but the proceeds only resolved or repaid a small amount of the loans.</p>\r\n<p>\u00a0</p>\r\n<p>A federal arrest warrant was issued for Mizrahi in the United States District Court, Central District of California, on May 15, 2012, after he was charged with bank fraud, false statements to a federally insured financial institution, and aiding and abetting and causing an act to be done.</p>", "images": [{"large": "https://www.fbi.gov/wanted/wcc/aviv-mizrahi/@@images/image/large", "caption": "Photograph taken in 2006", "original": "https://www.fbi.gov/wanted/wcc/aviv-mizrahi/@@images/image", "thumb": "https://www.fbi.gov/wanted/wcc/aviv-mizrahi/@@images/image/thumb"}, {"large": "https://www.fbi.gov/wanted/wcc/aviv-mizrahi/mizrahi-photo-a.jpg/@@images/image/large", "caption": "Photograph taken circa 2009", "original": "https://www.fbi.gov/wanted/wcc/aviv-mizrahi/mizrahi-photo-a.jpg", "thumb": "https://www.fbi.gov/wanted/wcc/aviv-mizrahi/mizrahi-photo-a.jpg/@@images/image/thumb"}, {"large": "https://www.fbi.gov/wanted/wcc/aviv-mizrahi/mizrahi3.jpg/@@images/image/large", "caption": "Photograph taken in 2009", "original": "https://www.fbi.gov/wanted/wcc/aviv-mizrahi/mizrahi3.jpg", "thumb": "https://www.fbi.gov/wanted/wcc/aviv-mizrahi/mizrahi3.jpg/@@images/image/thumb"}], "nationality": "Israeli", "height_min": 69, "weight_min": 170, "id": 71}]
