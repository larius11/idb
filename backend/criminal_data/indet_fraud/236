Conspirators posing as sellers then negotiated via e-mail with unsuspecting buyers in the United States. These \"sellers\" sent fraudulent invoices, that appeared to be from legitimate online payment services, to the victim buyers, with instructions for payment to bank accounts held by other conspirators in the United States. These conspirators opened United States bank accounts under false identities using fraudulent passports made in Europe by other conspirators. When victims wired money to an account identified on the false invoices, the conspirator associated with that account would be notified and then would withdraw the proceeds and send them via wire transfer to another conspirator based on e-mailed instructions.</p>\r\n<p>\u00a0</p>\r\n<p>A federal arrest warrant was issued for Dumitru Daniel Bosogioiu on December 20, 2012, in the United States District Court, Eastern District of New York, Brooklyn, New York, after he was charged by indictment for Conspiracy to Commit Wire Fraud, Money Laundering, Passport Fraud, and Trafficking in Counterfeit Service Marks; Wire Fraud; and Money Laundering.</p>", "images": [{"large": "https://www.fbi.gov/wanted/cei/dumitru-daniel-bosogioiu/@@images/image/large", "caption": null, "thumb": "https://www.fbi.gov/wanted/cei/dumitru-daniel-bosogioiu/@@images/image/thumb", "original": "https://www.fbi.gov/wanted/cei/dumitru-daniel-bosogioiu/@@images/image"}, {"large": "https://www.fbi.gov/wanted/cei/dumitru-daniel-bosogioiu/bosogioiu2.jpg/@@images/image/large", "caption": "", "thumb": "https://www.fbi.gov/wanted/cei/dumitru-daniel-bosogioiu/bosogioiu2.jpg/@@images/image/thumb", "original": "https://www.fbi.gov/wanted/cei/dumitru-daniel-bosogioiu/bosogioiu2.jpg"}], "nationality": "Romanian", "height_min": null, "weight_min": 154, "id": 236}]
