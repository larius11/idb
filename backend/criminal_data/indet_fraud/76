It is alleged that from December 2006 to October 2008, through fake advertisements placed on legitimate companies\u2019 websites, Jain and his accomplices deceived internet users into believing that their computers were infected with \u201cmalware\u201d or had other critical errors in order to encourage them to purchase \u201cscareware\u201d software products that had limited or no ability to remedy the purported defects.</p>\r\n<p>\u00a0</p>\r\n<p>Jain and his co-conspirators allegedly deceived victims, through browser hijacking, multiple fraudulent scans and false error messages, into purchasing full paid versions of software products offered by their company, Innovative Marketing, Inc. The proceeds of these credit card sales were allegedly deposited into bank accounts controlled by the defendant and others around the world, and were then transferred to bank accounts located in Europe. When customers complained that their purchases were actually fraudulent software, call center representatives were allegedly instructed to lie or provide refunds in order to prevent fraud reports to law enforcement or credit companies.</p>\r\n<p>\u00a0</p>\r\n<p>On May 26, 2010, Jain was indicted in Chicago, Illinois, by a federal grand jury for the United States District Court, Northern District of Illinois.
