            <h2>About our website</h2>
            <p class="lead">On The Run is a website that allows people to draw interesting connections between the FBI Most Wanted Page and information
            on different types of crimes as well as information on the states in which these crimes were committed.</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Intended Users: Anyone interested in learning about crime/criminals</li>
              <li>Explanation: This integration of disparate data allows people to not only see specfic information about each criminal, but also a macro look at crime in the states in which they committed their crimes. </li>
              <li>Group Name: The Slackers</li>
              <li>Group Members: Ricardo Riveron, Roshan Dongre, Zara Louis, Ramon Perez, Krishna Ramdeep</li>
              <li>Total Number of Commits: {{tot_commits}}</li>
              <li>Total Number of Issues: {{tot_issues}}</li>
              <li>Total Number of Unit Tests: 0</li>
              <li>Data Sources Used And How They Were Scraped:</li>
              <ul>
                <li><a href="https://crime-data-explorer.fr.cloud.gov/api" rel="nofollow">FBI Crime Stats API</a></li>
                <ul>
                  We used the requests module to scrape this data using python. This API provided
                  useful crime statistics shown on each of our model pages.
                </ul>
                <li><a href="https://www.fbi.gov/wanted/api" rel="nofollow">FBI Most Wanted API</a></li>
                <ul>
                  We used the requests module to scrape this data using python. This API provided
                  information on the criminals on our webpage.
                </ul>
                <li><a href="https://developers.google.com/maps/" rel="nofollow">Google Maps API</a></li>
                <ul>
                  We got an API key from Google Maps and then embedded the code provided in our HTML.
                  This provided us with maps on our model pages.
                </ul>
                <li> We also are going to be using the Google News API, World Bank API, and potentially
                  other APIs as we further develop the project
                </li>
              </ul>
              <li>Tools Used: Flask, Requests, Bootstrap, Travis CI, Postman, Slack, GitHub</li>
                <ul>
                  <li> Flask- The core of our project as it handles the API data requests and acts as an interface that communicates with the front-end of our application</li>
                  <li> Requests- The requests module is what we are using to handle parsing the information from the APIs we are using </li>
                  <li> Bootstrap- The Bootstrap template is the core of our front-end for this project and is the main framework used by most front-end developers</li>
                  <li> Travis CI- While we did not use Travis CI directly for this phase of the project, we did set it up as it will be a useful tool during the next phases
                    as we build out our website and integrate testing. Travis CI is a great continuous integration tool that is very useful in robust applications such as ours</li>
                  <li> Postman- Postman is a tool that allows one to build and test APIs and we used it for creating our API for this project. While we did not implement
                    testing for this phase we will be using it extensively in the upcoming phases, notably IDB2 </li>
                  <li> Slack- Slack is a messaging service that allows software developers to share and discuss code and ideas, with the great feature of GitHub integration. We used Slack
                    extensively in this phase and it was our primary means of communication </li>
                  <li> GitHub- GitHub is a open source code sharing platform that we used to store our code and coordinate with each other </li>
